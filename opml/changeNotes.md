    * drummer.this.how

        * On a walk today I was going over things I wanted to look at, based on what Iâ€™m hearing from [Drummer](http://drummer.scripting.com/) users, and standalone files is high on the list. The thought had been that weâ€™d do it based on the partially done feature in Old School. But then I realized that Old School isnâ€™t the only way to do standalone pages. Look at how the [Drummer docs](http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/about.opml) work. Why shouldnâ€™t Drummer users have the ability to do docs like that? Indeed. And then I recalled that we have that [for LO2](http://my.this.how/davewiner/howtos.opml), so why not do it for Drummer? Yes. Itâ€™s done and it works. :boom:

        * An example, the canonical [states.opml](http://drummer.scripting.com/davewiner/states.opml), viewed through this lens.

            * <http://drummer.this.how/davewiner/states.opml>

        * I just constructed another path to the file as follows:

            * states.opml is a public file in my Drummer directory.

            * I direct the request at a special site on the server in a folder called drummer.this.how.

            * The second part of the URL is my username.

            * And the third part is the name of the OPML file.

            * Itâ€™s just a simple [PagePark plug-in](http://pagepark.io/docs/plugins.md), written in JavaScript.

        * It should work for you too!

            * Questions, comments [here](https://github.com/scripting/drummerSupport/issues/105).

    * http.client verb, day 2

        * Thereâ€™s a new version of the [http.client](http://docserver.scripting.com/?verb=http.client) verb.

        * You can help by running a simple experiment, [explained here](https://github.com/scripting/drummerRFC/issues/6#issuecomment-962468957). Itâ€™s definitely something a poet can run, but itâ€™s mostly for plumbers. ðŸ˜€

        * Before testing please reload your Drummer web app to get the latest changes.

        * For now, the changes are only in web Drummer. I use Electric Drummer myself so you know getting a new release of that is high on my list.

        * Devs: This is very fluid right now, if you see things that are wrong, *now* is the time to speak up. Once itâ€™s frozen, the no-breakage rule kicks in.

        * This is a *central verb*, and the better it is, the more flexible Drummer scripting will be. Itâ€™s how Drummer will connect to the web. Everything will go through it. It pays to get this right.

        * This is the [thread](https://github.com/scripting/drummerRFC/issues/6).

    * New verb: http.client

        * Iâ€™ve been working on a big HTTP client verb, that does all the things youâ€™d ever want to do via HTTP.

        * This is a first release. It will get more features over time. And there will be breakage, thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m putting [the thread](https://github.com/scripting/drummerRFC/issues/6) to discuss this on the RFC site.

        * I want feedback, and reserve the right to make breaking changes as is made very clear on the [DocServer page](http://docserver.scripting.com/?verb=http.client).

    * Tools-for-thought databases thread

        * Kevin Tofel started off an [interesting thread](https://github.com/scripting/drummerRFC/issues/5).

        * I still want all my OPML archives in various [tools-for-thought databases](https://github.com/scripting/drummerRFC/issues/5#issuecomment-961942204).

        * Iâ€™m most hopeful wrt LogSeq. But eventually we will have lots of databases (imho) that work well with OPML.

        * And I think even would-be-dominant products like Roam will want to open up, rather than be left out of the party.

        * PS: An important point I donâ€™t want anyone to miss â€“

            * You can have OPML in JSON. We have a [toolkit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/opml?activeTab=readme) that reads OPML files and returns JavaScript structures. From there, do whatever you want. Save it as JSON. Itâ€™s up to you. I wouldnâ€™t have left this stone un-turned-over, so before assuming something like that doesnâ€™t exist, ask.
