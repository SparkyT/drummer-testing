It &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; designed to approachable, and documented -- so if you have had success with PP, congratulations, it's because you are able to break a problem down into its components and figure out what you want to do, and then patiently try to figure out if or how the product can do it. That's how it works for me, when I use someone else's software. I do the work to organize the problem, and if I don't -- I find I don't get help.

					<outline text="I think a standard may be emerging, Markdown used as a way to store outlines. It plays a similar role to the one OPML plays.

					<outline text="It's a little awkward because the format doesn't have a name, as far as I know. It's a &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; small subset of Markdown. I don't think it makes sense to use the .md extension, but that's what LogSeq uses, so we will too, for now. I've been calling the format markdown/outline where I've been writing about it in docs and development notes. However this is just a name I made up. There also does not appear to be a spec. At some point I will write one if only to document what we're producing and consuming in Drummer. " created="Thu, 06 Jan 2022 15:27:30 GMT"/>
