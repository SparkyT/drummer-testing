It &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; designed to approachable, and documented -- so if you have had success with PP, congratulations, it's because you are able to break a problem down into its components and figure out what you want to do, and then patiently try to figure out if or how the product can do it. That's how it works for me, when I use someone else's software. I do the work to organize the problem, and if I don't -- I find I don't get help. Even when I do carefully specify the problem there's no help. That's the way it works." created="Thu, 17 Feb 2022 15:10:28 GMT"/>

I've been calling the format markdown/outline where I've been writing about it in docs and development notes. However this is just a name I made up. There also does not appear to be a spec.
