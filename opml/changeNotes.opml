					<outline text="But -- it is really imporant that at least a few people try each change that's posted here within a few hours of its posting. That's how we build a rhythm. It really does become much harder to address problems when I've moved on from that area of the product. If you own a house, it's like this -- you have the roofing guys there working on stuff, and you remember there's a leak under the upstairs bathroom. But you don't think of it until a week after they've left. It's going to cost a lot more if you have to have the come out again. The time to speak up is when that part of the product is being worked on." created="Tue, 16 Nov 2021 13:13:02 GMT"/>

					<outline text="The thing I want you to know is that I can't work on this product in any meaningful way without interaction coming back from users. That's not &quot;I won't&quot; -- it's &quot;can't.&quot; I will at some point give up and do other things. As I've mentioned before this has been happening regularly with all the products I've created in the last few years. It sucks. I want to work, and share what I create, but it only works if people participate." created="Tue, 16 Nov 2021 13:15:27 GMT"/>

Does it work for you? I wasn't getting good reports on the problem, they were vague and not reproducible. So I've been trying out things that make it more conservative. Seems a shame to slow a feature down when it might not have anything to do with the problem people are experiencing. But how could I know? The communication has been really inadequate.

					<outline text="I suggested he try my &lt;a href=&quot;http://publicfolder.io/&quot;&gt;Public Folder&lt;/a&gt; app. I was hoping he would use it because then I would have someone who could test its use with Drummer in a real world setting, and work with me to create a smooth workflow for people working from the web Drummer. It really helps to have another human being with the perspective of a user as something is developing. And I wanted to solve the problem not just for E/D for for web Drummer too." created="Thu, 21 Oct 2021 20:55:08 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So, I had an idea how this might work, but unfortunately it wasn't possible to connect from the web browser to a local web server, which is actually what the Public Folder app is.

Tis a shame. We were so much more innocent then! :boom:" created="Thu, 21 Oct 2021 20:56:32 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Then I had the idea that since Public Folder is able to write files to S3, and Drummer scripts can read those files, that might work. And -- &lt;i&gt;tadahh&lt;/i&gt; -- it did work, resulting in version 0.4.8 of &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/publicFolder/&quot;&gt;Public Folder&lt;/a&gt;, which is now available for download.
