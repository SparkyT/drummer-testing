			<description>The other day I was &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/03/02/kvelling.png&quot;&gt;kvelling&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1630759941433589761&quot;&gt;how great ChatGPT was&lt;/a&gt; at finding &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/03/02/paywalllessfeeds.png&quot;&gt;feeds for news sites&lt;/a&gt; that didn't have paywalls. Until I noticed that some of the sites &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/03/02/oops1.png&quot;&gt;most definitely&lt;/a&gt; did &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/03/02/oops2.png&quot;&gt;have paywalls&lt;/a&gt;. So it's not perfect. It's a totally 1.0 kind of thing. If you don't know what that means, it might be a good time to re-read &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microserfs&quot;&gt;Microserfs&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>BTW, I wish ChatGPT would statically render their results pages, so I don't have to do screen shots just to quote them. Make it easier for us to promote our discoveries. It's so ridiculous that in 2023 we're still using screen shots as the way to hook networks together.</description>

			<title>Dirty Shirt</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've been to Jamaica a couple of times and I swear I've heard people use the term &quot;dirty shirt&quot; as a verb. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When someone &lt;i&gt;dirty shirts&lt;/i&gt; you, it's as if they did something that left a stain on your shirt, something obvious and not nice and everyone can see it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But when I searched for the term &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;sxsrf=AJOqlzWNBsqdLDa4woVMkIinhiwcSHSpNg:1677792242754&amp;q=%22dirty+shirt%22+%22jamaican%22+slang&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiegYuVl779AhVhMVkFHcFaDOoQ5t4CegQIMxAB&amp;biw=1551&amp;bih=1097&amp;dpr=2&quot;&gt;on Google&lt;/a&gt;, or asked ChatGPT, they offered weird and wrong ideas for what the term means. I checked in with my friend &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+Dave+Jacobs&quot;&gt;Dave Jacobs&lt;/a&gt; about this, he also has the same understanding of what the term means, but he couldn't find our definition anywhere on the web either. At least now the correct definition will show up here on my blog.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Tonight's Knicks game was pure delight. Haven't enjoyed basketball this much since &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+linsanity&quot;&gt;Linsanity&lt;/a&gt;. I still don't buy that there's a Knicks-Nets rivalry. There aren't any Nets fans. They are a backup team so if the Knicks are out of town you can still go to a game. Now that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2023/03/01/kevin-durant-hasnt-talked-to-kyrie-irving-since-nets-trade/&quot;&gt;carpetbaggers&lt;/a&gt; have left, everything is back to normal. Dallas and Phoenix can have them. Good riddance.</description>

			<description>I continue to take a break after much michegas converting to email identity and HTTPS. I've got Electric Drummer more or less working, and I think I'm going to stop short of getting all of it working, given that I want to keep taking this break and am not up for more grinding away. Something changed over here, and I'm more inclined to let you all take care of yourselves for a while. Mastodon is fine, even though I can't write for it using the tools I like to use. So far only my blog qualifies, and my docs and this.how stuff. I'm enjoying the winter here in the Catskills and dreaming of other cool things to do. Software right now far from my mind. That could change at any time.</description>
