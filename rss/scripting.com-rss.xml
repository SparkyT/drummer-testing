Niches are defended by lack of interop. You can see categories being born with limited interop, features vendors can say deliver interop, it would be hard to argue, but they don't deliver much practical interop for users. That's why the tech industry was so ho-hum about RSS. Where's the fun for them if they can't lock users into a niche product and then another and another? As a technologist, what gets me excited about computer networks are all the combinations users can make, but that works only if there's &lt;i&gt;lots&lt;/i&gt; of interop.</description>

			<description>I heard a BBC reporter ask a Ukrainian official if they would attack Russian military in Russia. What kind of question is that. Of course they would. It's a war. Russia attacked Ukraine. All of Russia is a fair target for the Ukraine military.</description>
