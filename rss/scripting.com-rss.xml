			<description>Loving my Keurig coffee maker. I've been stocking up on all kinds of pods. Favorite so far is hazelnut flavored, not real -- really tasty. I never thought I'd want to try out all these different kinds of coffee. I wonder if I'm getting an espresso machine next.</description>

Now you all have seen up close the &quot;move fast and break things&quot; philosophy of Silicon Valley, also known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Government_Efficiency&quot;&gt;DOGE&lt;/a&gt;. They do this with investors' money. This was a preview of how they will govern, after Trump, when Silicon Valley is fully running the world. We need to get some tech background in your writing. The history of tech is very much the history of politics as we go forward. We had a merger, and you can and should incorporate our history in your understanding of US history.</description>
