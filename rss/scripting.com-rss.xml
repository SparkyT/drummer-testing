If one of them did, we could start curated lists of feeds put together by smart people and influencers. The first podcast client that did this would open up the market, and stand out from the pack. I've been &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2012/06/29/twoSuggestionsForPodcastCl.html&quot;&gt;asking&lt;/a&gt; for this from the inception of podcasting twenty years ago. I had it in my first podcatcher. It would be great if one of the popular clients of today adopted the idea. Happy to help.</description>

			<description>Here is the monthly &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/opml/2024/09.opml&quot;&gt;archive&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt; in OPML, for September. I've been systematically creating &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/opml&quot;&gt;this archive&lt;/a&gt; since May 2017. And also have been able to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/opmlOtherSources&quot;&gt;reconstruct&lt;/a&gt; the archive for most of Scripting News going back to 1994.  I've been doing a lot of work with the contents of this archive in the last month.</description>
