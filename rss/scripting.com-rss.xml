			<description>Also worth mentioning, because I have signed up for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/tweets.opml.org&quot;&gt;Tweets-in-JSON&lt;/a&gt;, I now have all &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/tweets.opml.org/blob/main/users/davewiner/2022/04.json&quot;&gt;my tweets from April&lt;/a&gt; automatically archived in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/tweets.opml.org/tree/main/users/davewiner&quot;&gt;collection&lt;/a&gt; of JSON files on GitHub. If you're a geekish person and you use Twitter, you should sign up too, even if you don't know how you'll use the archive today, you might be enticed at some time in the future, and will like to have this archive around ready to play with. BTW it understands threads and preserves the structure. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/tweets.opml.org/blob/main/users/davewiner/2022/04.json#L997&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to an example in my archive. I bet if you're clever you could figure out how to display that thread just from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/tweets.opml.org/blob/main/users/davewiner/2022/04.json#L997&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>I want my karass</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The problem on Twitter is that no one will hear this tweet. Because trying to stay in touch with 1000 people is utterly impossible. Some people follow many more. And then there are the people you don't follow who have a good idea. How do you keep that channel open without also leaving it open for spammers and scammers. We haven't figured that out yet. As far as I know, no one is trying. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What we are left with -- everyone's attention span even for the things you pay relatively close attention to is infinitesimal, and it's also constantly deteriorating. So it gets even harder for ideas to circulate because nothing penetrates.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What I yearn for is a &quot;karass&quot; system. One for the 12 people who I want to communicate with who I know will pay attention, and will let me build up ideas over a period of weeks or months. And I do the same for them. Their projects connect with mine, we're constanty improving the system, creating new gateways, modifying others.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In order for that to work, we basically have to be working on a project together.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've had that work once in 2001, when I was working on Radio UserLand with a small team of people spread out over the world. Ever since I have been trying to recreate the experience.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
