			<title>Blogs for social web apps</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;In a new product I'm working on, I'm including links to the blogs of the social media apps I use. I notice that most of them have one. This is why:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You can put a title on a post on a blog.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You can include links (invariably announcements have links).&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You can edit posts.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Simple text styling.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Blogs have feeds.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I'm looking for the official blogs of the social apps I use -- Mastodon, Bluesky, Twitter, Threads. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If so, what's the feed URL? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/294&quot;&gt;place&lt;/a&gt; to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: It seems dumb to have two places for writing. &lt;s&gt;Also I bet Bluesky wrote their own blogging software, which is why there's no feed for their blog, which is awkward because Bluesky itself has feeds. As a programmer, I don't think I could maintain both codebases, and i'm pretty sure the blog is the one that'll get abandoned.&lt;/s&gt; Update: they do &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/294#issuecomment-1973571777&quot;&gt;have a feed&lt;/a&gt; for their blog. At some point there won't be a distinction between blogging and social media-ing. Remember the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html&quot;&gt;tiny little text boxes&lt;/a&gt; have to go. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: Twitter's blog has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.x.com/en_gb/blog.rss&quot;&gt;really shitty title&lt;/a&gt;, it shows up in the list as English (UK). That should be fixed to something like Twitter Blog. I know how this happens, obviously they're maintaining more than one language, so the title is given from their point of view. As a reader, it has to make sense in a list of feeds from different publishers. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/01/howCouldYouTellThatsTwitter.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; to illustrate. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
