			<description>I'm &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1520786270728990721&quot;&gt;trying to figure out&lt;/a&gt; why Wordle's reports get mangled when they come through the Twitter API. I find when I paste them into a local text file they &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/05/01/wordleMangle.png&quot;&gt;look pretty bad&lt;/a&gt; too.</description>

			<title>I want my karass</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The problem on Twitter is that no one will hear this tweet. Because trying to stay in touch with 1000 people is utterly impossible. Some people follow many more. And then there are the people you don't follow who have a good idea. How do you keep that channel open without also leaving it open for spammers and scammers. We haven't figured that out yet. As far as I know, no one is trying. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What we are left with -- everyone's attention span even for the things you pay relatively close attention to is infinitesimal, and it's also constantly deteriorating. So it gets even harder for ideas to circulate because nothing penetrates.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What I yearn for is a &quot;karass&quot; system. One for the 12 people who I want to communicate with who I know will pay attention, and will let me build up ideas over a period of weeks or months. And I do the same for them. Their projects connect with mine, we're constanty improving the system, creating new gateways, modifying others.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In order for that to work, we basically have to be working on a project together.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've had that work once in 2001, when I was working on Radio UserLand with a small team of people spread out over the world. Ever since I have been trying to recreate the experience.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: According to the Wikipedia page on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat%27s_Cradle#Bokononism&quot;&gt;Cat's Cradle&lt;/a&gt;, a karass is &quot;a group of people linked in a cosmically significant manner, even when superficial linkages are not evident.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
