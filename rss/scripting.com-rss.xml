			<description>Mastodon has a cute way to validate sites as being yours. If you put your masto address in the text of the site that's good enough. But it has to be HTTPS. Oh well. I think they get most things right at Masto, but the trying to force people to adopt HTTPS is selling out to &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; and their thirst to own the web, which is imho not theirs to own.</description>

			<description>If you run a blog or other site, check your copyright notices. We're in a new year folks. For example the copyright notice on this blog should've changed. And then I realize there is no freaking copyright notice. I better &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/01/01/copyrightNotice.png&quot;&gt;fix that&lt;/a&gt;. Today is a day of fixing things.</description>

			<description>A new application for AI. Rate the humor level of a tweeted &quot;joke&quot; response. If people knew how unfunny their supposed jokes were they might think again before inflicting them on others. Better yet, score people on the quality of the jokes they actually post. Publish that score next to their number of followers.</description>

			<description>Requiring people to use one uppercase, one lowercase, one number, one special character in a password is a joke. It doesn't make your password more secure. What it does is make it impossible to remember the password.</description>

			<description>I remember when I saw a product that expired after 2000 and thought that I had arrived in the future. Hah. It's 2023 now. That's just ridiculous. It's impossible that I actually have lived this long. It's all bonus from hereon-out.</description>
