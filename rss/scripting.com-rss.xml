			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1542798905661956097&quot;&gt;Will we&lt;/a&gt; come to despise Christianity in the US? I ask this question because up to this last week I felt that Christianity was other peopleâ€™s problem, not mine. But theyâ€™ve captured the Supreme Court, and theyâ€™re using it to force their religion on the rest of us. So itâ€™s no longer something that I can be neutral about. It seems that eventually, maybe very soon, we will come to hate Christianity.</description>
