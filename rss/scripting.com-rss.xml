			<description>Listen to &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/i-dissent-biden-declares-war-on-supreme-court-trump-7-2-24/id1633301179?i=1000660868719&quot;&gt;today's Countdown&lt;/a&gt; podcast. I was cheering out loud during the first segment. When you read this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C864lCsuwbK&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;, you'll see why. I tried listening to the NYT Daily podcast today, but it made me hate them all over again, starting with saying how great a week it has been for Trump. You can say that, imho, but you have to say right after that, that it was a terrible week for the rest of us. Because any good news for Trump is awful news for everyone else. And I do mean everyone, including the people who plan to vote for him again.</description>

			<title>Plan for Biden re Supreme Court</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a lightly edited version of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C864lCsuwbK&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on Threads. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I understand why the Dems don't want to be the first to use the new rule passed by the Supreme Court, but I think they should consider this plan:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Arrest the members of the Supreme Court who just voted for the new rule about presidential immunity.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Nominate six replacements, sorry no Repubs this time.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The Senate ratifies them.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Once they're installed, they hold an emergency session to restore Roe v Wade, and to undo all the other crazy BS they did and then revoke the new rule, and re-assert the rule of law that &lt;i&gt;especially&lt;/i&gt; applies to the president.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And I don't know what they do with the ones they arrested but frankly I don't care. Leave them in jail until they figure it out.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And it's about time Trump was arrested and held without bail, so he can't do any more damage to the US while awaiting trial. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@palafo&quot;&gt;Patrick LaForge&lt;/a&gt;, a longtime friend who works at the NYT: &quot;I think the distinction here is that the president can't be prosecuted for violations of law but they would still be acts unsupported by law that a court could block or an agency could refuse to carry out. But they sure have created a mess.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C87TO13pkO_&quot;&gt;My response&lt;/a&gt;: Maybe starting to do it is enough to get the courts to undo the mess asap.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

You can now go directly to the OPML version of a blogroll, and to the HTML page we discovered it in. I know all this must seem strange, hard to figure out what's going on. That's how I feel about it too. But I know there's interesting data here, how people are connected to people. I'm still trying to figure out how to make a browser that engages the mind in that. It can take a long time to figure these things out. I had the basic idea for a blog in 1994, but it wasn't until 1999 that we really had it figured out and implemented for non-techies. This may be like that, or the browser might be just around the corner.</description>

			<title>Jeff Jarvis and Dave in conversation</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I just did an approx 40 minute &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/07/01/jeffJarvisDiscusses.m4a&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; interview and discussion with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Jarvis&quot;&gt;Jeff Jarvis&lt;/a&gt;. I know Jeff from the early days of blogging. He was one of the best discussion leaders at BloggerCon. And he's an accomplished author and educator. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We talk about how to organize news for people who are information starved by whatever it is that our news sources are doing, which is really hard to figure out, but in the end (I argue) who cares why, we have a problem to solve, so let's get on with it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I talk about the blogging at the Dean campaign in 2004, that's how they got around journalism. I'm sure that's where we have to go, put together what we think would be the Biden blog if the campaign was being run by Joe and Nicco, and I'd be on board, so would Jeff, and we'd help Heather Cox Richardson, and amplify anyone who is making sense and supports democracy. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It could be funded by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/07/01/1342.html&quot;&gt;People's PAC&lt;/a&gt;, or something like it. It wouldn't take very much money, it's just a blog. But it would have powerful ideas that cut through the bullshit, and great videos, and we'd organize marches where people show up to help people.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And the campaign would never stop, we'd always be organizing.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is the discussion I wanted to start. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Hope you enjoy! :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Jeff's mike is much better than mine. Gotta work on that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
